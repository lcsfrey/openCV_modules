  ### Graph Reader
  Program that reads dots drawn on paper, computes the shortest path between all the dots, and displays that path on the screen. The shortest path is computed using using C++ code that has been compiled into a shared library file and imported into Python. The source code for the shortest path algorithm can be found in my TSP_Algorithms repository.
